# Financial Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect financial fraud using machine learning models. Fraud in financial statements can significantly affect investors, stakeholders, and the overall operation of firms. This project explores various factors likely to indicate financial fraud and evaluates different models based on their accuracy in predicting fraudulent activities.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset named `FinancialFraud.xlsx`, which contains various financial attributes along with a fraud indicator for 434 companies in Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). The dataset is preprocessed to remove irrelevant columns and handle missing values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project conducts an extensive EDA to understand the distribution of fraud cases and the relationship between different financial indicators. Various visualizations, including count plots and correlation matrices, provide insights into the data's structure and relationships.

## Models Evaluated
Several machine learning models are explored to predict financial fraud, including:
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Logistic Regression
- AdaBoost
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

## Results
The project compares the performance of these models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It discusses the effectiveness of each model in detecting fraud and suggests the best-performing models based on the evaluation.
